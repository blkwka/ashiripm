Ashiriâ€™s Garden is not a physical place we can travel to. It is an idea of spreading innovation, creativity, and
        unity to artists everywhere. I want people to collaborate, meet new faces, and build connections. Animation,
        Music, Art, and passion are the things we thrive for and fuels myself along with others. That driving force to
        make something great is what I want to bring out. A dream with no action is just delusion and some people may
        need
        a push in the right direction. I thank you for your time & hope you enjoy it.- Bill Odiwuor Kawaka
